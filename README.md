# Finger is the official bot for The Royal Army of The Kingdom of Samuel, and a few others.
This is basically a shitty little discord.py bot I cobbled together over a few weekends of free time one day that I decided, "hey, why not try use this as a project to understand python more!"
So yeah here we are.

If you want to run this, here's the steps in order. **NOTE**: You will need an existing Discord bot for this to work. If you don't know how to do that, *sigh*, [here](https://gist.github.com/CrazycatASG/b8c0c54c20e4cbb23b7ef20bda21d475)

1. Clone this repo using ```git clone https://github.com/CrazycatASG/fingerbot.git```
2. Create a .env file, and create a variable named TOKEN (***in full caps!!!***), and paste your bot token in there.
3. That should be it. Run ```py main.py``` to get started
